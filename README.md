### Code

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40056747/print-a-list-of-dictionaries-in-table-form) was consulted for guidance on how to print the scoreboard data to the terminal in the form of a table using Tabulate.
- Credit to [gnuton](https://gist.github.com/gnuton/3c7a46447d2be0aee0b2) on Github for the code that within the "slow_print()" function.
- [Fsymbols](https://fsymbols.com/generators/carty/) was used to generate the ASCII text for the Main Menu, Scoreboard & Instructions pages.
- [Python Pool](https://www.pythonpool.com/python-colorama/) was consulted for guidance on how to print coloured text to the terminal using Colorama.
- The “logo” ASCII art was obtained from [asciiart.eu](https://www.asciiart.eu/video-games/zelda) & modified by me to fit the terminal.
- The “triforce” ASCII art was obtained from [emojicombos.com](https://emojicombos.com/legend-of-zelda-ascii-art).
- The code within the “clear_terminal()” function was provided by my mentor, Derek McAuley.

### Acknowledgements

- Special thanks to my mentor Derek McAuley for his support with the project, particularly with helping me to troubleshoot an issue I was having with deployment  and for providing guidance on throwing exceptions and printing ASCII art to the terminal for a more visually appealing program. Derek also provided me with code to clear the terminal, which is compatible on multiple operating systems. 
- I would also like to thank Oisin from the tutor support team for helping me to troubleshoot an issue I had with iterating through the questions & answers for the quiz.
